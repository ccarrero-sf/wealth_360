CASE-625;Mortgage Consultation;"2023-11-12 12:01:00 Customer: Hi, I’m interested in applying for a mortgage with you but I have some specific questions about your rates and terms for first-time buyers. Could you provide some detailed information?
2023-11-12 12:02:00 Support Agent: Absolutely, I’d be happy to assist you. Are you looking for a fixed-rate or a tracker mortgage? Also, how long do you want the term to be?
2023-11-12 12:10:00 Customer: I’m leaning towards a fixed-rate because I prefer having a predictable payment schedule. What rates do you offer and what are the terms involved?
2023-11-12 12:11:00 Support Agent: We offer fixed-rate mortgages for terms of 2, 5, or 10 years. The rates start as low as 1.5% for two years, which is quite competitive. This would be ideal if you’re looking for stability in your initial years of homeownership.
2023-11-12 12:12:00 Customer: That sounds good. Can you explain the differences in monthly payments for the different terms?
2023-11-12 12:13:00 Support Agent: Certainly! For a £200,000 mortgage amount, at a 1.5% fixed rate for 2 years, you’d be looking at monthly payments of approximately £760. Extending to a 5-year term, the rate adjusts to about 1.8%, which would make the monthly payments around £775.
2023-11-12 12:21:00 Customer: What about the fees? Are there any upfront costs or hidden fees I should be aware of?
2023-11-12 12:23:00 Support Agent: Good question! There’s an arrangement fee of £999 for our mortgages, which you can choose to pay upfront or add to the balance of your mortgage. There are no hidden fees, but it’s important to consider other costs like solicitor fees and property surveys.
2023-11-12 12:25:00 Customer: I see. And what happens after the fixed-rate period ends?
2023-11-12 12:26:00 Support Agent: After the fixed-rate period, your mortgage would revert to our Standard Variable Rate (SVR), which currently stands at 4%. However, most of our clients opt to remortgage at that point to secure a better rate.
2023-11-12 12:31:00 Customer: What’s involved in the remortgaging process? Is it complicated?
2023-11-12 12:33:00 Support Agent: It’s quite straightforward, especially if you’re remortgaging with us. We handle most of the administrative tasks, and typically, there are fewer legal hurdles than with your initial mortgage. We also offer free valuations on remortgages.
2023-11-12 12:34:00 Customer: You’ve been very helpful. One last question: what kind of support do you offer for first-time buyers like myself throughout the buying process?
2023-11-12 12:36:00 Support Agent: We pride ourselves on supporting first-time buyers extensively. We offer first-time buyer workshops that explain the home buying process, a dedicated mortgage advisor who can guide you through each step, and flexible appointment times to fit your schedule.
2023-11-12 12:38:00 Customer: That’s reassuring to hear. I think I have all the information I need for now. How do I proceed with the application?
2023-11-12 12:39:00 Support Agent: I can initiate the process right now over the phone, or if you prefer, you can apply online through our website. Either way, I’ll ensure that your application is handled smoothly.
2023-11-12 12:43:00 Customer: Let’s start the process over the phone. I’m ready to provide any details you need.
2023-11-12 12:44:00 Support Agent: Great! I’ll need some personal information to begin with, such as your full name, address, current employment details, and a summary of your financial situation.
2023-11-17 09:13:00 Customer: Hello again, I applied for the mortgage as we discussed, and I received an application reference number, but I haven’t heard anything back yet. Can you check the status for me?
2023-11-17 09:16:00 Support Agent: Of course, I can help with that. Could you please provide me with the application reference number?
2023-11-17 09:17:00 Customer: Sure, it’s MW34872019.
2023-11-17 09:18:00 Support Agent: Thank you for providing the reference number. Give me a moment to look up your application.
2023-11-17 09:26:00 Support Agent: I’ve checked our system, and it looks like your application is currently under review by our underwriting team. There seems to be a slight delay due to a high volume of applications we’re processing.
2023-11-17 09:28:00 Customer: I understand there might be delays, but I’m a bit anxious as I have a deadline approaching with the seller. How long do you think this will take?
2023-11-17 09:30:00 Support Agent: Typically, it takes about two weeks from application to initial decision. However, I’ll mark your file as urgent and notify the underwriting team about your situation to help expedite the process.
2023-11-17 09:31:00 Customer: That would be great, thank you. Will I receive updates, or should I check in periodically?
2023-11-17 09:32:00 Support Agent: We’ll definitely keep you updated via email and SMS as your application progresses. However, feel free to reach out if you haven’t heard from us or if you have any more questions.
2023-11-17 09:33:00 Customer: Thanks, I’ll wait for your update then. One more thing, can you tell me more about the insurance options that are available with the mortgage?
2023-11-17 09:35:00 Support Agent: Absolutely. We offer building insurance, which is mandatory, and contents insurance, which is optional but highly recommended. We also have a life insurance policy designed to cover the mortgage in case of death, giving you peace of mind.
2023-11-17 09:36:00 Customer: Do I need to decide on the insurance now, or can it wait until the mortgage is approved?
2023-11-17 09:38:00 Support Agent: It’s best to have your insurance in place by the time you complete the purchase, but you can wait until your mortgage approval to make these decisions. We can provide quotes and help you set everything up closer to the completion date.
2023-11-17 09:39:00 Customer: Okay, I think that covers everything for now. I’ll look forward to your updates and will get back to you about the insurance once we move forward.
2023-11-17 09:40:00 Support Agent: Sounds good! I’m here to help whenever you need it. Don’t hesitate to contact me. Have a great day!
2023-12-04 14:01:00 Customer: Hi, I received a notification saying that some documents are missing from my application, but I’m certain I’ve uploaded all the required ones. Can you help me figure out what’s going on?
2023-12-04 14:07:00 Support Agent: I’m sorry to hear about the confusion. Let’s sort this out right away. Can you tell me which documents you uploaded, so I can check them against what’s listed as missing in our system?
2023-12-04 14:09:00 Customer: I uploaded my proof of income, the last three months of bank statements, and my proof of identity, which included my passport and a recent utility bill.
2023-12-04 14:10:00 Support Agent: Thank you for that information. Allow me a moment to review your file and check our system.
2023-12-04 14:16:00 Support Agent: I’ve checked your application, and it seems there was a glitch on our end. Our system was unable to automatically recognise and process your council bill as proof of address. However, I can confirm that your documents are indeed all uploaded correctly. I will update the status and inform the underwriting team that no documents are missing.
2023-12-04 14:18:00 Customer: I appreciate your help with this. Delays like these are quite stressful, given the timelines we’re working with.
2023-12-04 14:19:00 Support Agent: I completely understand, and I apologize for any stress caused. I’ve marked your application for urgent review to make up for the time lost due to this error. I will personally follow up to ensure there are no further delays.
2023-12-04 14:21:00 Customer: Thank you for handling this swiftly. How will I be informed of the progress now?
2023-12-04 14:23:00 Support Agent: You’ll receive automated updates via email and SMS as your application moves through each stage. Additionally, I will make sure to give you a personal call if there are any updates or further information required from your side.
